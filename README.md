then i make preprocessing on them 
And make Data Agumentation 
make some visualization to our data and their Labels
Define the model architecture
Compile the model
Define early stopping to prevent overfitting
Train the model
use regulaization to prevent overfitting
Fine tunning using(VGG16,
    ResNet50,
    InceptionV3,
    DenseNet121)
    choose the best model(DenseNet121)
    testing with sampels outside the dataset
